## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the severity of road accidents based on a dataset containing various attributes such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and crash types. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning models for prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be a CSV file containing information about road accidents. The dataset includes features such as accident severity, weather conditions, road surface conditions, and crash types.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_Severity_Crash.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd traffic_Severity_Crash 
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook traffic_Severity_Crash.ipynb
   ```

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load and display the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and key patterns in the data.
- **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to predict accident severity based on the features. Models may include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and others.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze the importance of different features in predicting accident severity.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed workflow for analyzing and predicting accident severity and crash types. The results section includes model evaluation metrics and visualizations of feature importance.
